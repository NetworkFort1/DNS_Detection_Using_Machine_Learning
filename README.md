# DNS Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository presents a machine learning-based approach for DNS detection, aiming to identify and analyze malicious activities within DNS traffic. The project leverages a diverse range of machine learning algorithms to create a robust detection system capable of distinguishing between normal and malicious DNS queries. By utilizing labeled datasets and implementing a training pipeline, the model is trained to recognize patterns associated with malicious DNS behavior.

## Key Features
